Giphy Holiday Displays

This is a quick way for users to enjoy various holiday gifs.  

Created utilizing GIPHY.API, the page displays 10 holidayas.  When the user clicks on the holiday, 10 Gifs appear.  
If the user clicks on any of the displayed Gifs, they animate until such time that they are clicked again then they the animation is paused/stopped. 

Users also have the ability to add additional holiday buttons which will act in the same manner as the preexisting buttons.
